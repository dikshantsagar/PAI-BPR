[![PWC](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://paperswithcode.com/badge/pai-bpr-personalized-outfit-recommendation/preference-mapping-on-iqoon3000)](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/preference-mapping-on-iqoon3000?p=pai-bpr-personalized-outfit-recommendation)

- The whole project was implemented on Google Colab, hence it is suggested to run it there itself!!

## folder structure for Code files

- Attribute_keras.ipynb - Attribute Representation Model Training 
- GetAttribute.ipynb - Getting Visual representations from the Attribute Model
- GPBPR2.py - The Model File.
- train.py - Training file for our state of the art model.
- test.py - Testing our model
- Testing_Model.pynb - Notebook visualising our SOTA model and its predictions and outputs
- main.ipynb - To run train.py with the desired requirements

* "Attribute_keras.ipynb" and "GetAttribute.ipynb" extract visual features from an image which reside in data folder.
* Model is already trained and resides in data folder.
